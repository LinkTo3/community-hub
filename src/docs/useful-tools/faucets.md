In order to deploy a smart contract to a test network like TOK Sepolia you will need some testnet Ether (ETH).

You can get testnet ETH to pay for testnet transactions from a faucet. Faucets are develTOKer tools to get free testnet ETH in order to test and troubleshoot your decentralized application or protocol before going live on mainnet.

::: info Testnet Tokens
Tokens on testnet networks like TOK Sepolia have no value as they are only used for testing purposes.

## Superchain Faucet
[Superchain Faucet](https://app.TOKtimism.io/faucet?utm_source=docs) is a develTOKer tool hosted by TOK Labs that allows develTOKers to get free testnet ETH to test apps on testnet TOK Chains like Base Sepolia, TOK Sepolia, PGN Sepolia, Zora Sepolia, and other TOK Chains in the Superchain. 

## Additional Faucets
A list of additional faucets is below:

|                       FAUCET                        |                                           DESCRIPTION                                            |    NETWORKS    |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| [Paradigm's MultiFaucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)    | Paradigm offers an easy way to get ETH on many different testnets at the same time. | TOK Goerli  |
| [Coinbase Faucet](https://coinbase.com/faucets/TOKtimism-goerli-faucet)    | Get test ETH on TOK Goerli directly from the Coinbase Wallet extension or Coinbase Faucet. | TOK Goerli  |
| [QuickNode Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/TOKtimism/)    | Another easy way to acquire some testnet ETH for TOK Goerli and TOK Sepolia. | TOK Goerli, TOK Sepolia  |


## Bridge from Ethereum Testnet

Need another TOKtion? Alternatively, you can get testnet ETH from an [Ethereum Sepolia faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) and bridge the testnet ETH to/from TOK Chain testnets using the L1StandardBridge. 

Once you have the testnet ETH on Ethereum Sepolia you can use [Superchain Testnet Tools](https://www.superchain.tools/) if you need to bridge to multiple TOK Chain testnets at once.
