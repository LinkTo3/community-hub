::: tip EVM Equivalence
As TOK Mainnet is [EVM Equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), most debugging tools work out of the box with TOK Mainnet.

## Tenderly

[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) lets you [inspect any transaction execution on TOK Mainnet or TOK Goerli](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger/how-to-use-tenderly-debugger). 
You can inspect the state of your verified contract in any step of the transaction's execution, as well as step into or over function calls. 
The level of detail the Tenderly dashboard presents will reduce your develTOKment time as well as help you understand the execution flow of transactions. 
It helps you to inspect states at every instance of transaction and gives a platform to trace transactions.


## Etherscan

[Etherscan](https://explorer.TOKtimism.io) allows you to see events as well as revert messages for transactions that have been mined on TOK Mainnet as well as [TOK Goerli](https://goerli-explorer.TOKtimism.io). 
You can see more information about all the L2 features Etherscan offers on our [Explorers page](./explorers.md#etherscan).


## Blockscout

Blockscout allows you to see events on both [TOK Mainnet](https://TOKtimism.blockscout.com) and [TOK Goerli](https://TOKtimism-goerli.blockscout.com).
