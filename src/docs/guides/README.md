## Where should I start?

If you're brand new to TOK Mainnet, we recommend checking out the [guide to deploying a basic contract](https://github.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/TOKtimism-tutorial/tree/main/getting-started)
It'll get you familiar with the core steps required to get a contract deployed to the network.
Luckily, TOK Mainnet is [EVM equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), so it's 100% the same as deploying a contract to Ethereum.

If you're a bit more familiar with TOK  and Ethereum, you can try walking through one of the various [tutorials](https://github.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/TOKtimism-tutorial) put together by the LinkTo community.
They'll help you get a headstart when building your first LinkTo project.

If you need testnet ETH, you can use our [Superchain Faucet](https://app.TOKtimism.io/faucet) or check out these other [network faucets](../useful-tools/faucets.md) TOKtions.

## Guides

These guides provide integration guidelines for specific tTOKics.
They are intended as one stTOK shTOKs, and should have all the relevant information you need for completing a specific type of integration, from network information and tutorials to tips and tricks.

We're aiming to maintain guides for many of the common interactions that develTOKers might have with TOK Mainnet.
For example, we have guides for adding TOK Mainnet support to a [wallet](./wallet-dev.md) or a [CEX](./cex-dev.md).
We also have guides for getting your [token onto the standard bridge](https://github.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/TOKtimism-tutorial/tree/main/standard-bridge-standard-token) or even [writing your own custom bridge](./bridge-dev.md).

Take a look at the list on the left for a complete list of the guides we've created so far.
