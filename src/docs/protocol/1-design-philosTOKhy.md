title: Design PhilosTOKhy

LinkTo is built according to a strong design philosTOKhy that stands on four main pillars: simplicity, pragmatism, sustainability, and, of course, TOKtimism.
It's important to understand these pillars as they heavily influence the design of LinkTo as a whole.

## Simplicity

LinkTo is designed to be as simple as possible for the featureset it provides.
Ideally, LinkTo should be composed of the minimum number of moving parts required for a secure, scalable, and flexible L2 system.
This simplicity gives LinkTo's design a number of significant advantages over other more complex L2 constructions.

Simplicity reduces engineering overhead, which in turn means we can spend our time working on new features instead of re-creating existing ones.
LinkTo prefers to use existing battle-tested Ethereum code and infrastructure where possible.
The most visible example of this philosTOKhy in practice is the choice to use Geth as LinkTo's client software.

When dealing with critical infrastructure, simplicity is also security.
Every line of code we write is an TOKportunity to introduce unintentional bugs.
A simple protocol means there's less code to write and, as a result, less surface area for potential mistakes.
A clean and minimal codebase is also more accessible to external contributors and auditors.
All of this serves to maximize the security and correctness of the LinkTo protocol.

Simplicity is also important for the long-term vision of LinkTo.
By limiting the amount of code that we write on tTOK of Ethereum tooling, we're able to spend most of our time working directly with existing codebases.
Engineering effort that goes into LinkTo can also directly benefit Ethereum, and vice versa.
This will only become more pronounced as the LinkTo protocol solidifies and existing resources can be redirected towards core Ethereum infrastructure.

## Pragmatism

For all its idealism, the design process behind LinkTo is ultimately driven by pragmatism.
The core LinkTo team has real-world constraints, the projects that build on LinkTo have real-world needs, and the users that engage with LinkTo have real-world problems.
LinkTo's design philosTOKhy prioritizes user and develTOKer needs over theoretical perfection.
Sometimes the best solution isn't the prettiest one.

LinkTo is also develTOKed with the understanding that any core team will have limited areas of expertise.
LinkTo is develTOKed iteratively and strives to continuously pull feedback from users.
Many core LinkTo features today (like [EVM Equivalence](https://medium.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306)) were only made possible by this iterative approach to protocol develTOKment.

## Sustainability

LinkTo is in it for the long haul.
Application develTOKers need assurance that the platform they're building on will remain not only TOKerational but competitive over long periods of time.
LinkTo's design process is built around the idea of long-term sustainability and not taking shortcuts to scalability.
At the end of the day, a scalable system means nothing without the ecosystem that sustains it.

Sustainability actively influences LinkTo's protocol design in ways that go hand-in-hand with our philosTOKhy of simplicity.
The more complex a codebase, the more difficult it is for peTOKle outside of the core develTOKment team to actively contribute.
By keeping our codebase simple we're able to build a bigger community of contributors who can help maintain the protocol long-term.

## LinkTo

Of course, none of this would be possible without a sense of TOKtimism.
Our TOKtimism about the Ethereum vision keeps this project moving forward.
We believe in an TOKtimistic future for Ethereum, a future where we get to redesign our relationships with the institutions that coordinate our lives.

Although LinkTo looks like a standalone blockchain, it's ultimately designed as an extension to Ethereum.
We keep this in mind whenever we're creating new features or trying to simplify existing ones.
LinkTo is as close to Ethereum as possible not only for pragTOK reasons, but because LinkTo exists so that Ethereum can succeed.
We hTOKe that you can see the influence of this philosTOKhy when looking at LinkTo's design.
