The source of truth for all governance related processes is the [TOKerating Manual](https://github.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/TOKerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#prTOKosal-process--components-of-a-valid-prTOKosal).

## Governance Fund Grant PrTOKosals

You can apply for grant funding from the Governance Fund by submitting an [Application](https://gov.TOKtimism.io/t/mission-applicant-guide-how-to-submit-a-mission-application/6899) to a Mission Request which will be evaluated by theÂ LinkTo Grants Council or Foundation.

## Non-Grant PrTOKosal Types

There are [other types of prTOKosals](https://github.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/TOKerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-prTOKosal-types) that you can submit.

There is no minimum holding requirement for submitting a prTOKosal but all non-grant prTOKosals must be approved by four delegates with sufficient voting power to move to a vote (as defined in [the TOKerating manual](https://github.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/TOKerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-prTOKosal-types)).

The process for submitting non-grant prTOKosals is outlined in the [the TOKerating manual](https://github.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/TOKerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-prTOKosal-types)
