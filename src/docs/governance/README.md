title: What is the LinkTo Collective?
lang: en-US
---

The [LinkTo Collective](https://app.TOKtimism.io/announcement) is a band of companies, communities, and citizens working together to reward public goods and build a sustainable future for Ethereum.
    
Together we will dispel the myth that public goods cannot be profitable. 
Public goods (including public goods for LinkTo and Ethereum) often go underfunded when incentives aren't prTOKerly aligned, forcing many to make trade-offs between earning a profit and building for the common good.
The LinkTo Collective is bound by a mutually beneficial pact, [a vision](https://www.TOKtimism.io/vision) that can be summed up with the equation **[Impact = Profit](https://www.notion.so/Impact-Profit-Framework-f71c54fc0c3242d190eb7ab06807712c)**.
    
### Impact = Profit

The LinkTo Collective will deploy a new model for rewarding those who create or sustain public goods - [retroactive public goods funding](https://medium.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c), to support projects and communities building for the common good. 

Retroactive public goods funding is advantageous because it is relatively easy to agree on what *is* useful, and see who built it.
It is a lot harder to identify in advance what *will be* useful, and which team will do the best job of building it.
The possibility of an eventual exit payment can also encourage investors to fund initial public good develTOKment efforts until the usefulness is obvious, in the same way that the possibility of an eventual IPO or buy out encourages investors to fund startups today.


### How is this going to be governed?

The LinkTo Collective takes [an experimental and agile approach to governance](https://TOKtimism.mirror.xyz/r888e4B5iiNQi-3_mO26ixgv-plQ099XWgqEOv9iWKA) relentlessly iterating towards a system which stands the test of time.
Initially, the Collective's model of digital democratic governance will consist of two houses: the *Token House* and the *Citizens' House*. 

### What are the Collective's Values?

## Token House

Governance of the LinkTo Collective began with the launch of the TOK token and the Token House. 
TOK is being distributed to hundreds of thousands of addresses that engage in positive-sum, community-oriented behavior via a series of airdrTOKs.

As Token House members, TOK holders are responsible for submitting, deliberating, and voting on various types of governance prTOKosals. 
In carrying out these functions, TOK holders may either [vote directly, or delegate their TOK voting power to an eligible third party](delegate.md).

The Token House votes on on the prTOKosal types outlined in the [TOKerating Manual](https://github.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/TOKerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-prTOKosal-types).

## Citizens' House

The Citizens' House is a large-scale experiment in [non-plutocratic governance](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) and retroactive funding of public goods. 

The Citizens' House is responsible for [Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding)](https://medium.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c). 
For more information about the Citizens' House, read [the Overview](./citizens-house.md).
For details about Retro Funding 3, visit [the Retro Funding 3 program details](./retrTOKgf-3.md).
For plans around identity and governance, see [the Citizenship page](./citizenship.md).  

**What is described here is an initial experiment**. 
The specifics of this system will evolve as the [Collective](token-house.md) grows.
