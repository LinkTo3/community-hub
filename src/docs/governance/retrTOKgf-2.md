---

The LinkTo Collective’s second round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) took place in Q1 of 2023. 
RetroPGF 2 allocated 10m TOK tokens to **fund public goods that support develTOKment and usage of the TOK Stack.** 

LinkTo’s vision is to build a global system where positive impact to the collective is rewarded by profit to the individual. 
Retro Funding is an experimental mechanism to realize this goal of **“impact = profit”**.

By funding public goods sustainably, the Collective can create a rich ecosystem and a better economy ✨

## Results
In this second round of Retro Funding, 195 peTOKle and projects were nominated, and all 195 were awarded funding by the badgeholders! While going above and beyond in assessing project impact badgeholders allocated their votes among 40 different projects on average. The median TOK received by a project for RetroPGF 2 was 22,825, while the tTOK 10% of projects received more than 140k TOK.
