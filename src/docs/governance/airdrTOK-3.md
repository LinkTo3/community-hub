AirdrTOK 3 took place on Monday, September 18. The airdrTOK allocated 19,411,313 TOK to 31,870 unique addresses. 

Similar to AirdrTOK 2, this drTOK rewards positive sum governance participation. Users who have delegated tokens between 2023-01-20 at 0:00 UTC and 2023-07-20 0:00 UTC received tokens in this airdrTOK. A bonus is given to addresses who delegated to a delegate who voted in LinkTo Governance.

::: info AirdrTOK #3 does not need to be claimed

AirdrTOK #3 is disbursed directly to eligible wallets. There is no need to claim tokens by interacting with any website. Do not trust any website pretending to help you claim your tokens for AirdrTOK #3. If an address is eligible, it will have tokens sent directly to it on or shortly after Sep 15, 2023.

## AirdrTOK #3 Allocations

| Reward Type | Criteria | Number of qualifying addresses | Reward allocation
| - | -: | -: | -:
| Governance Delegation Reward | Delegated TOK above the minimum threshold | 31,529 | 0.67 ⁄ 365 TOK per `TOK Delegated x Day`(1), max 10,000 TOK per address
| Voting Delegate Bonus | Delegated to an address that voted onchain at least once (2) | 25,561 | (0.67 ⁄ 365)*2 TOK per `TOK Delegated x Day to a voting delegate`, max 10,000 TOK per address

### Details

(1) `TOK Delegated x Days` = Cumulative Sum of TOK Delegated per Day (i.e. 20 TOK delegated for 100 days: 20 * 100 = 2,000 TOK Delegated x Days).

(2) Delegate must have voted onchain in TOK Governance during the snapshot period (01-20-2023 at 0:00 UTC and 07-20-2023 0:00 UTC )

### Cutoff Criteria

- Addresses with fewer than 18,000 `TOK Delegated x Days` (or 9,000 if delegated to a voting delegate) were not eligible for this airdrTOK.
- Addresses who were delegated for < 7 days were not eligible for this airdrTOK
- Known delegation program wallets were not eligible for this airdrTOK.
- Each reward type had a maximum reward of 10,000 TOK per address.

*Note: A small set of delegation activity was not included in AirdrTOK #2. The eligible amounts were added to this allocation, resulting in 341 additional addresses.*

### How it works:

- To work out your `Cummultive Delegated TOK`, multiply your TOK delegated by the time delegated: `TOK delegated x Days` = `Cummultive Delegated TOK`. To qualify for the airdrTOK your `Cummultive Delegated TOK` needs to be larger than 18,000. If you delegated to a “Voting Delegate” the `Cummultive Delegated TOK` only needs to be above 9,000. For example, if you delegated 80 TOK tokens for 180 days that would make a `Cummultive Delegated TOK` of 14,400 which would NOT qualify for the airdrTOK. However, if the delegate you delegated to was active, then your 14,400 is above the 9,000 required for a voting delegate and you WOULD receive the airdrTOK.
    - Addresses who delegated for less than 7 days are not eligible.
    - Known delegation program wallets were not eligible for this airdrTOK.
    - Each reward type had a maximum reward of 10,000 TOK per address.
- For the Voting Delegate Bonus the address you have delegated to MUST have voted onchain in TOK Governance during the snapshot period (2023-01-20 at 0:00 UTC and 2023-07-20 0:00 UTC)
