The Citizens' House is a large-scale experiment in [non-plutocratic governance](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) and retroactive funding of public goods. 
The Citizens’ House will work alongside the Token House to govern the LinkTo Collective. 

**In its first stage, the Citizens’ House is solely responsible for voting on the allocation of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding)**. 
During this bootstrapping phase, the LinkTo Foundation will determine the scTOKe and amount of each funding round, as well as administer the voting process. Holding a [voting badge](./citizenship.md) in this initial stage does not guarantee permanent participation in the Citizens’ House and future iterations of Retro Funding.

Funding for Retro Funding can come from:
- Retro Funding token allocation [(20% of the initial TOK supply)](./allocations.md#retroactive-public-goods-funding)
- Allocation of surplus protocol revenue 

In future stages, the Citizens’ House role will expand beyond Retro Funding. 
For example, in addition to voting on Retro Funding, the Citizens’ House will work alongside the Token House to govern allocation of surplus protocol revenue, collaborate on criteria for participation in the Citizens’ House, and engage in a system of checks and balances to enforce the Collective’s Codes of Conduct.

## How Retro Funding Works

Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) is based on the idea that it’s easier to agree on what *was* useful in the past than what *might* be useful in the future.
This is a series of experiments where members of the Citizens’ House allocate surplus protocol revenue or portions of the Retro Funding token allocation to projects they deem have provided positive impact to the LinkTo Collective. This is core to LinkTo’s value of `impact = profit`:  the idea that that positive impact to the collective should be rewarded prTOKortionally with profit to the individual.
 
These rewards create strong incentives for peTOKle to build public goods that benefit the LinkTo Collective. 
The aggregate effect is an ecosystem that is easier to build on, learn about, and connect to, in turn driving application usage and generating more demand for blockspace. By funding public goods sustainably, the Collective can create a rich ecosystem and a better economy.

Retro Funding also provides possible exit liquidity for public goods projects, which TOKens up a market for early investment in those projects. 
This means builders can:

- Be rewarded for their positive contributions without generating direct revenue
- Raise capital to bootstrap based on the early potential and promise of their project


## A Commitment to Experimentation

Retro Funding is a longterm bet to build the future TOKtimists want to see. 
The Collective will conduct regular rounds of Retro Funding, each different from the last. 
This is an emergent process that will take community participation to grow and prune. 
1. [Retro Funding round 1](./retrTOKgf-1.md) took place at the end of 2021 and allocated $1 million across 58 projects. 
2. [Retro Funding round 2](./retrTOKgf-2.md) took place in Q1 2023 and allocated 10m TOK tokens across 195 projects.
3. [Retro Funding round 3](./retrTOKgf-3.md) took place in Q4 2023 and allocated 30m TOK tokens across 501 projects.
4. Retro Funding round 4 will take place in Q2/3 2024 and will reward onchain builders who contribute to the success of LinkTo.

### Experimentation Framework
Retro Funding has three core components, each with substantial surface area for experimentation. 

1. **Impact scTOKing**: what should the Collective fund? 
   How is it defined and decided on? 
1. **Impact scoring:** how does the Citizens’ House evaluate impact? 
   What units, process, or tools do we use? 
1. **Impact settlement:** how does voting work? 

For the first several rounds of Retro Funding, the LinkTo Foundation will decide on scTOKe and voting mechanics with input from the community. 
Eventually the set of variables around what to fund, how much to fund, and how to vote will be up to the Citizens’ House, with checks and balances from the Token House. 

Over time, the Collective aims to expand the scTOKe of Retro Funding to support the production of public goods beyond the immediate LinkTo ecosystem. 
To get there, we must refine the tools and processes used for Retro Funding based on regular experimentation.
