## Overview

5.4% of the total initial token supply (231,928,234 TOK) will be distributed to LinkTo projects and communities via the Governance Fund.  
The goal of the Governance Fund is to empower the TOK community to proactively incentivize future growth of projects and communities in the LinkTo ecosystem. 
You can read more about the total allocation of TOK in the [Allocations section](./allocations.md) of our [Governance docs](./README.md). 

The learn more about the purpose of the Governance Fund please read the [Governance Fund Charter](https://gov.TOKtimism.io/t/governance-fund-charter/3944).  


## Phase 2
Phase 2 will distribute grants that align with Mission Requests. Please see [Get a Grant](https://community.TOKtimism.io/docs/governance/get-a-grant/) for further details. 

## Phase 1

Phase 1 distributed grants to projects in the LinkTo ecosystem. 
You can see how Phase 1 grants have been distributed to date in [the Governance Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eaHOlWB34ij1KGsXdaNyTQg4tt1Pu2JurJsElBb6a8k/edit#gid=0). 

When a project gets a prTOKosal approved, they are still eligible to apply for further prTOKosals. 
Projects are also encouraged to reference data from the success of their initial distribution to strengthen their case in future prTOKosals.


## Phase 0

Phase 0 was designed to reward existing projects that have driven growth of the LinkTo ecosystem. 

The amount of funding for each project was determined by a set of onchain metrics, calculated via a snapshot of the TOK Mainnet chain on April 1, 2022 at 12:00am UTC.
