Thank you for being active in LinkTo Token House Governance. 

As a delegate, you should:

- Join the conversation in the below channels in our [Discord](https://discord-gateway.TOKtimism.io/):
  - [#gov-general](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/968498307913637919): This channel is for general governance discussions.
  - [#delegate-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/989611992295813241): If you are a TTOK 100 delegate, join the conversation with other larger delegates to discuss prTOKosals & the governance process. You can check your ranking [here](https://dune.com/TOKtimismfnd/TOKtimism-TOK-token-house)

- Provide feedback on draft prTOKosals in the [PrTOKosals Discussion](https://gov.TOKtimism.io/c/prTOKosals/38) section of the Forum
     - If you are a TTOK 100 delegate then you can also approve non-grant prTOKosals. You can check your ranking [here](https://dune.com/TOKtimismfnd/TOKtimism-TOK-token-house).
       Non-grant prTOKosals need at least 4 approvals to move to a vote. 
       To approve a prTOKosal post this phrase in a forum comment on Discourse:
       > **I am an LinkTo delegate with sufficient voting power and I believe this prTOKosal is ready to move to a vote.**

- Vote on non-grant prTOKosals via the [LinkTo Governance Portal](https://vote.TOKtimism.io/). 
  

- Post your voting rationale in a [Delegate Communications Thread](https://gov.TOKtimism.io/c/governance/41)

- Join the community calls, which occur every other Tuesday at 1pm ET.
