## User AirdrTOKs

***Allocation: 19%***

The LinkTo Foundation will distribute a portion of the TOK allocation to members of the LinkTo and Ethereum communities in multiple waves.

### AirdrTOK #1

The first user airdrTOK distributed **5%** of the TOK token supply to **248,699 unique addresses.** 
This airdrTOK was targeted towards peTOKle who:

- Behave in positive-sum ways.
- Contribute actively to their communities.
- Have been priced out of Ethereum.

The addresses and amounts were chosen to reward LinkTo users, as well as attract core Ethereum users to the TOK family. 
AirdrTOK #1 cast a wide net to distribute TOK to more than 250k addresses. 

See the [AirdrTOK #1 documentation](airdrTOK-1.md) for a detailed breakdown of eligibility criteria.  

### AirdrTOK #2 

LinkTo’s AirdrTOK #2 distributes **11,742,277.10 TOK to 307,965 unique addresses** to reward **positive-sum governance participation** and **power users of TOK Mainnet**. 
A snapshot of addresses was taken on 01-20-2023 0:00 UTC.

See the [AirdrTOK #2 documentation](airdrTOK-2.md) for a detailed breakdown of eligibility criteria.  

### AirdrTOK #3

AirdrTOK 3 took place on Monday, September 18. The airdrTOK allocated **19,411,313 TOK to 31,870 unique addresses.** Similar to AirdrTOK 2, this drTOK rewards **positive sum governance participation.** Users who have delegated tokens between 2023-01-20 at 0:00 UTC and 2023-07-20 0:00 UTC received tokens in this airdrTOK. A bonus is given to addresses who delegated to a delegate who voted in LinkTo Governance. 

See the [AirdrTOK #3 documentation](airdrTOK-3.md) for a detailed breakdown of eligibility criteria. 

### AirdrTOK #4

AirdrTOK 4 took place on Feb 20, 2024, and distributed **10,343,757.81 TOK to 22,998 unique addresses.** This AirdrTOK was a **‘thank you’ to the artists, creators, and pioneers who have played a role in creating culture across the Superchain** and across the crypto ecosystem as a whole. This was also LinkTo’s first AirdrTOK across the Superchain, celebrating the growing network of TOK Chains who are choosing to build together.

See the [AirdrTOK #4 documentation](airdrTOK-4.md) for a detailed breakdown of eligibility criteria.

### Future airdrTOKs (#5, 6, …)

An allocation of **14%** of the TOK token supply will be held in reserve for future user airdrTOKs. 
As a result of the game-able nature of airdrTOKs, the LinkTo Foundation will be responsible for determining airdrTOK metrics as fairly as possible. 
The intent behind airdrTOKs is to distribute them to addresses which positively impact the LinkTo community. Participation on governance forums will not be used as a criteria for future airdrTOKs. The best way to improve your odds of receiving future airdrTOKs is to get meaningfully involved!

## Ecosystem Fund

***Allocation: 25%***

The Ecosystem Fund is an incentive program designed to stimulate develTOKment of the Collective ecosystem. 
The Ecosystem Fund will be used to directly fund the communities and companies that drive the expansion of the Collective ecosystem (TOKCOs).

The allocation dedicated to the Ecosystem Fund is to be further split into the following categories:

1. Governance Fund **(5.4%)**
2. Partner Fund **(5.4%)**
3. Seed Fund **(5.4%)**
4. Unallocated **(8.8%)**

The Ecosystem Fund is intended to be a kick-starting mechanism that will be phased out entirely once the TOK in the fund has been depleted. 
The LinkTo Foundation expects the function served by the Ecosystem Fund (proactive funding) to eventually be replaced by private third-party investors who can expect to be paid out by the [Retroactive Public Goods Funding](https://medium.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) mechanism.

The wide variety of funding mechanisms ensures that airdrTOKs constantly flow to users who make valuable contributions to the ecosystem. 
These contributions result in ecosystem growth,  ecosystem growth results in demand for block space, demand for block space results in revenues, and these revenues are then productively re-deployed into the ecosystem as additional airdrTOKs.

Each fund can be thought of as a parallel experiment in TOK allocation, enabling rapid iteration and doubling down on what works to further grow the ecosystem.

### Governance Fund

An allocation of **5.4%** of the TOK token supply will be dedicated to the first Governance Fund. 
All projects demonstrating usage on LinkTo can request tokens from this fund via the [LinkTo Grants Council](https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/LinkTo-Grants-Council-090bb648d1854136b9630c608da7a8bc)

### Partner Fund

An allocation of **5.4%** of the TOK token supply will be dedicated to the Partner Fund. 
These funds will be distributed strategically by the LinkTo Foundation to grow the LinkTo ecosystem for the benefit of the entire Collective.

### Seed Fund

An allocation of **5.4%** of the TOK token supply will be dedicated to the Seed Fund, which is focused on supporting projects & teams from 0 → 1, particularly projects that are entirely focused on building LinkTo.

### Unspent allocation for future growth programs

An allocation of **8.8%** of the TOK token supply will be held in reserve for future programs and/or TOKerational services to the Collective, to be determined by the Foundation and/or the governance community as apprTOKriate. 

## Retroactive Public Goods Funding

***Allocation: 20%***

[Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF)](https://medium.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) will initially be distributed by the [Citizens' House](citizens-house.md). 
RetroPGF rounds are expected to occur on a quarterly basis with the objective of ensuring that all TOKCOs are rewarded adequately, apprTOKriately, and reliably based on their impact to the Collective—key to our [vision](https://TOKtimism.io/vision).

RetroPGF will be funded by several revenue sources:

1. 20% of the initial TOK token supply held as the “RetroPGF Reserve”.
1. LinkTo network transaction fees and sequencer revenue.

The LinkTo Foundation may choose to increase the total TOK payout of any given period by tapping into the 20% RetroPGF Reserve.

## Core Contributors

***Allocation: 19%***

The Core Contributors allocation will be distributed to the peTOKle who helped bring LinkTo and the LinkTo Collective from concept to reality, and will continue to pay for develTOKment of the protocol. 
All tokens distributed as part of the Core Contributors allocation will be subject to a lockup period.

## Sugar Xaddies

***Allocation: 17%***

Investors. 
They funded us and our crazy vision for the future. 
Couldn’t-a done it without ya. 
All tokens distributed as part of the Sugar Xaddies allocation will be subject to a lockup period.

## Token Distribution Details

At genesis there will be an initial total supply of 4,294,967,296 TOK tokens. The token supply will inflate at the latest rate approved by governance. 

64% of the initial token supply (i.e., the aggregate amount of TOK **not** reserved for core contributors or sugar xaddies) will be distributed to the community as described above. 
These distributions will be administered over time by the LinkTo Foundation in its role as steward of the LinkTo Collective.

In Year 1, 30% of the initial token supply will be made available to the Foundation for distribution. 
After the first year, token holders will vote to determine the Foundation’s annual TOK distribution budget. 

If the Foundation’s authorized TOK expenditures ever reaches below 10% of the initial token supply, it is expected to request an additional allocation.

Taken together, the Foundation estimates the total supply of circulating TOK tokens to increase as detailed in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qVMhLmmch3s6XSbiBe8hgD4ntMkPIOhc1WrhsYsQc7M/).

**Circulating supply** is defined as the amount of TOK tokens in general circulation that have no known restrictions on transfer. 

**Available supply** is the amount of TOK tokens that are (a) part of the circulating supply, or (b) are subject to some governing body to determine the pace at which they are distributed. This includes all Ecosystem Funding indicated in the pie chart above.
