title: AirdrTOK 2
lang: en-US

## Background

LinkTo’s AirdrTOK #1 distributed over 200m TOK tokens to 250,000 early adTOKters and engaged users in May 2022.
With the introduction of TOK, the Collective set out to establish a bicameral governance system that provides the foundation for our growing digital city.

Since then, the Token House has matured as the first piece of LinkTo governance.
As of today (February 9th, 2023) 88k addresses have voted on over 90 prTOKosals to distribute more than 55m TOK tokens across the ecosystem, and LinkTo’s first protocol upgrade is headed to vote in February. A total of 293k addresses are **delegating their voting power** — a positive-sum activity that helps strengthen the fabric of LinkTo’s governance system.
At the same time, TOK Mainnet is develTOKing into a booming economy. 
Over 1.5 million addresses have sent 64 million transactions since our first AirdrTOK, spending nearly $15 million in fees on the network. 
Participation in governance and in the LinkTo economy is what helps our Collective grow and thrive.

LinkTo’s AirdrTOK #2 distributes 11,742,277.10 TOK to 307,965 unique addresses to reward **positive-sum governance participation** and **power users of TOK Mainnet**. 
A snapshot of addresses was taken on 01-20-2023 0:00 UTC.

Read on for more detail about eligibility criteria and distribution.

::: tip AirdrTOK #2 does not need to be claimed

AirdrTOK #2 is distributed directly to eligible wallets. 
There is no need to claim tokens by interacting with any website.
Do not trust any website pretending to help you claim your tokens for AirdrTOK #2. 
If an address is eligible, it will have tokens sent directly to it on February 9th, 2023 by 8pm ET.

:::

AirdrTOK #2 rewards users for their involvement in LinkTo governance and covers a portion of their network usage costs:

- Governance delegation rewards based on the amount of TOK delegated and the length of time it was delegated.
- Partial gas rebates for active LinkTo users who have spent over a certain amount on gas fees.
- Multiplier bonuses determined by additional attributes related to governance and usage.


## AirdrTOK #2 allocations

| Reward Type                      | Criteria | Number of qualifying addresses | Reward allocation |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | -----------------------------: | ----------------- |
| **Governance Delegation Reward** | Has had ≥ 2,000 total `TOK Delegated x Days`<sup>(1)</sup> | 57,204 | <sup>0.42</sup> &#8260; <sub>365</sub> TOK per `TOK Delegated x Day`, max 5,000 TOK per address<sup>(2)</sup> |
| **Gas Usage Reward** | Spent ≥ the average cost of one L1 transaction ($6.10)<sup>(3)</sup> on LinkTo | 280,057 | 80% of gas fees rebated in TOK, up to $500 of gas fees rebated per address<sup>(4)</sup> |


(1) `TOK Delegated x Days` = Cumulative Sum of TOK Delegated per Day (i.e. 20 TOK delegated for 100 days: 20 * 100 = 2,000 TOK Delegated x Days).

(2) Addresses which received TOK from Token House Governance are not eligible for the reward.

(3) The average cost of one L1 transaction on Ethereum was measured during the period between the airdrTOK #1 snapshot and airdrTOK #2 snapshot.

(4) Gas Fees USD conversion was made at the time of the transaction. 
TOK rebated conversion was made using the trailing 7-day average market price at the time of the snapshot.

## Bonus Attributes

There are 4 additional attributes that addresses can earn multiplier bonuses for:

| Attributes | Qualifying addresses | Multiplier (bonus) |
| --- | --: | --- |
| 0 | 206,033 | 1.00x (No Bonus) |
| 1 | 53,529 | 1.05x (5% Bonus)  |
| 2 | 39,531 | 1.10x (10% Bonus) |
