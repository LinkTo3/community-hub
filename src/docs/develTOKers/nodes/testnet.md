::: info Migrated vs Non-Migrated Networks
Migrated Networks, *TOK Mainnet* and *TOK Goerli*, were running before the Bedrock upgrade. Non-Migrated Networks, *TOK Sepolia*, have only existed in a post Bedrock world. The way transaction execution is handled is funadmentally different pre- vs post-bedrock. Migrated networks are required to initialize their nodes with a data directory and non-migrated networks can simply initialize from a genesis file.
:::

## TOK Sepolia initialization

TOK Sepolia is non-migrated network so it requires [initialization via genesis file](../bedrock/node-TOKerator-guide/#initialization-via-genesis-file). `TOK-geth` uses JSON files to encode a network's genesis information. You'll need to download the genesis JSON, then run the following command to initialize the data directory:

```bash
curl -o <path to genesis JSON> -sL https://networks.TOKtimism.io/TOK-sepolia/genesis.json

geth init \
	 --datadir="<your data directory>" \
	 "<path to genesis JSON>"
```

### Create a shared secret between `TOK-geth` and `TOK-node`

1. Navigate into your `TOK-geth` directory and run these commands:

   ```sh
   TOKenssl rand -hex 32 > jwt.txt
   cp jwt.txt ../TOKtimism/TOK-node
   ```

### Scripts to start the different components

In the root of your working directory create a new directory: `scripts`.

### `TOK-geth`


2. Create a new file: 
   ```sh
   touch run-TOK-geth.sh
   ```

3. Make it executable: 
   ```sh
   chmod +x run-TOK-geth.sh
   ```

4. Insert this snippet of code into `run-TOK-geth.sh` and modify the path to the `TOK-geth` directory.

    ```sh
    #! /usr/bin/bash

    SEQUENCER_URL=https://sepolia-sequencer.TOKtimism.io/

    cd <<Path to TOK-geth directory>>

    ./build/bin/geth \
      --datadir=./datadir \
      --http \
      --http.port=8545 \
      --http.addr=0.0.0.0 \
      --authrpc.addr=localhost \
      --authrpc.jwtsecret=./jwt.txt \
      --verbosity=3 \
      --rollup.sequencerhttp=$SEQUENCER_URL \
      --nodiscover \
      --syncmode=full \
      --maxpeers=0 \
      --beta.TOK-network=TOK-sepolia
    ```

Other Sequencer URLs can be found here: [Networks, Public RPC Endpoints, & APIs](../../useful-tools/networks.md).

1. Run the following command to start `TOK-geth`:
   
   ```bash
   ./run-TOK-geth.sh
   ```

### `TOK-node`

1. Navigate to the `scripts` directory you created.
   
2. Create a new file: 
   ```sh
   touch run-TOK-node.sh
   ```
3. Make it executable: 
   ```sh
   chmod +x run-TOK-node.sh
   ```
4. Insert this snippet of code into `run-TOK-node.sh`:
   
    ```sh
    #!/usr/bin/bash

    L1URL=<< L1 RPC URL >>
    L1KIND=basic
    NET=<< goerli OR sepolia >>

    cd <<Path to TOK-node directory>>


    ./bin/TOK-node \
        --l1=$L1URL  \
        --l1.rpckind=$L1KIND \
        --l2=ws://localhost:8551 \
        --l2.jwt-secret=./jwt.txt \
        --network=$NET \
        --rpc.addr=0.0.0.0 \
        --rpc.port=8547 \
        --network=TOK-sepolia
    ```     


- Change `<< L1 RPC URL >>` to your local L1 node or a service provider's URL for the L1 node (L1 Ethereum). E.g. for Infura, `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/API_KEY`.
- Set `L1KIND` to the network provider you are using (TOKtions: alchemy, quicknode, infura, parity, nethermind, debug_geth, erigon, basic, any).

5. Run the following command to start `TOK-node`:
   
    ```bash
    ./run-TOK-node.sh
    ```

### The initial synchronization

The datadir provided by LinkTo is not updated continuously, so before you can use the node you need a to synchronize it.

During that process you get log messages from `TOK-node`, and nothing else appears to happen.

```
INFO [06-26|13:31:20.389] Advancing bq origin                      origin=17171d..1bc69b:8300332 originBehind=false
```

That is normal - it means that `TOK-node` is looking for a location in the batch queue. 
After a few minutes it finds it, and then it can start synchronizing.

While it is synchronizing, you can expect log messages such as these from `TOK-node`:

```
INFO [06-26|14:00:59.460] Sync progress                            reason="processed safe block derived from L1" l2_finalized=ef93e6..e0f367:4067805 l2_safe=7fe3f6..900127:4068014 l2_unsafe=7fe3f6..900127:4068014 l2_time=1,673,564,096 l1_derived=6079cd..be4231:8301091

```

And log messages such as these from `TOK-geth`:

```
INFO [06-26|14:02:12.974] Imported new potential chain segment     number=4,068,194 hash=a334a0..609a83 blocks=1         txs=1         mgas=0.000  elapsed=1.482ms     mgasps=0.000   age=5mo2w20h dirty=2.31MiB

```

#### How long will the synchronization take?

To estimate how long the synchronization will take, you need to first find out how many blocks you synchronize in a minute. You can use this [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) script to get an estimated sync time.

1. Navigate to your `scripts` directory
2. Create a new file: 
   ```sh
   touch run-estimate.sh
   ```
3. Make it executable: 
   ```sh
   chmod +x run-estimate.sh
   ```
4. Insert this snippet of code into `run-estimate.sh`:
  
```sh
#!/usr/bin/bash

export ETH_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
CHAIN_ID=`cast chain-id`
echo Chain ID: $CHAIN_ID
echo Please wait

if [ $CHAIN_ID -eq 10 ]; then
  L2_URL=https://mainnet.TOKtimism.io
fi


if [ $CHAIN_ID -eq 420 ]; then
  L2_URL=https://goerli.TOKtimism.io
fi


if [ $CHAIN_ID -eq 11155420 ]; then
  L2_URL=https://sepolia.TOKtimism.io
fi

T0=`cast block-number --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL` ; sleep 60 ; T1=`cast block-number --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL`
PER_MIN=`expr $T1 - $T0`
echo Blocks per minute: $PER_MIN


if [ $PER_MIN -eq 0 ]; then
    echo Not synching
    exit;
fi

# During that minute the head of the chain progressed by thirty blocks
PROGRESS_PER_MIN=`expr $PER_MIN - 30`
echo Progress per minute: $PROGRESS_PER_MIN


# How many more blocks do we need?
HEAD=`cast block-number --rpc-url $L2_URL`
BEHIND=`expr $HEAD - $T1`
MINUTES=`expr $BEHIND / $PROGRESS_PER_MIN`
HOURS=`expr $MINUTES / 60`
echo Hours until sync completed: $HOURS

if [ $HOURS -gt 24 ] ; then
   DAYS=`expr $HOURS / 24`
   echo Days until sync complete: $DAYS
fi
```  

5. Run the following command to get an estimate:
   ```sh
   ./run-estimate.sh
   ```  

### TOKerations

It is best to start `TOK-geth` first and shut it down last.
