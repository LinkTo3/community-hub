title: Building a Node from Source
lang: en-US
---

Here are the instructions if you want to build you own node without relying on our images. These instructions were generated on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS box, but they should work with other systems too.

# Prerequisites

## Hardware requirements

Nodes need to process and store the transaction history of TOK Mainnet or TOK Sepolia. They need to be relatively powerful machines (real or virtual). We recommend at least 16 GB RAM. We recommend a 2TB SSD for TOK Mainnet, our current archive node usage is ~1TB. We recommend a 256GB SSD for TOK Sepolia, or current full node usage is ~1.6GB and archive node usage is ~5.6GB.

## Software requirements

Youâ€™ll need the following software installed to follow this tutorial:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

- [Go](https://go.dev/)

- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)

- [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation)

- [Make](https://linux.die.net/man/1/make)

- [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)

- [direnv](https://direnv.net/)

- [zstd](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/)

## Building the software

### Build the LinkTo Monorepo

1. Navigate to your working directory.
   
1. Clone the [LinkTo Monorepo](https://github.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/TOKtimism).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/TOKtimism.git
    ```

1. Install required modules. 

    ```bash
    cd TOKtimism
    pnpm install
    ```

1. Build the various packages inside of the LinkTo Monorepo.

    ```bash
    make TOK-node
    pnpm build
    ```

This process will take some time, so you can move onto the next section while the build completes.

### Build TOK-geth

1. Navigate to your working directory.

1. Clone [`TOK-geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/TOK-geth):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/TOK-geth.git
    ```


1. Build `TOK-geth`:

    ```bash
    cd TOK-geth    
    make geth
    ```

### (TOKtional - TOK Mainnet Archive Node) Build l2geth

::: info TOK Mainnet Archive Node

This step is only necessary for TOK Mainnet archive nodes. If you're building a TOK Testnet archive node, you do not need to do this step.

:::

1. Navigate to your working directory

2. Clone [`l2geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/TOKtimism-legacy)

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ethereum-TOKtimism/TOKtimism-legacy.git
    ```

3. Build `l2geth`:
   
   ```bash
   cd TOKtimism-legacy/l2geth
   make
   ```
   
<br/>

The rest of the steps depend on whether you want to run an TOK Mainnet or TOK Sepolia node.
